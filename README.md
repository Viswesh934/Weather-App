## Server-Side Component:

**Set Up:**

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `node server.js`
3. Access the app: Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

**MongoDB Configuration:**

* **Connection URL:** Currently set to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`, modify in `server.js` as needed.
* **Database Name:** Defaulting to `MLH`, update in `mongoose.connect` if desired.

**API Endpoint:**

## Contributing:

We welcome contributions to enhance the Weather App! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for bug fixes or improvements.

## License:

This Weather App is released under no license. Use, modify, and distribute it as you please!


## Additional Notes:
* This script imports city data from a worldcities.csv file into a local MongoDB database (defaults to localhost:27017/MLH). It defines a City schema for data structure, parses the CSV efficiently, inserts each row as a document, and handles errors. Run node import_cities.js after installing dependencies. Customize connection string and data extraction if needed. Enjoy effortless city data import!
* Feel free to add screenshots or gifs showcasing the app's features.
* Consider further customizing the README with specific instructions for your app, like environment setup or configuration details.
